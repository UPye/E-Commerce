## Overview
This is a first look at a completed Node.JS file by me. With this you are able to develop a front-end site to this database system. It will save information regarding products and their tags, categories, and product tags. 

## Installation
You will need to install env, express, sequelize, mysql2, and node (if not already downloaded). Install these packages to run this app.

## Future Developments
I would love to expand on this e-commerce server built, so that more product information may be included to expand on the ever growing e-commerce market. I would also love to include front-end code, so people may use it as a starter base for building their very own e-commerce store. Lastly, I would like to deploy this application to Heroku.

## Credits
I want to thank UCF coding bootcamp for the knowledge gained this week to construct this database. It was very well put together and easy to understand!
